	Algorithm:

	1. While it is not EOF, read the data according to the space separated column <name><lat long><population><area sq m> and store them into the temporary variables.
	2. Determine the type of region using a temporary variable that holds the key value.
	3. If it is a "Province", create a Province object using the data from the temporary variables and add it to the province vector.
	4. If it is a "Sub" (sub-district), create a Sub_District object using the data from the temporary variables, then add it to the sub_district vector.
	5. Since there could be more than 1 sub-district in each province, if the new read data (<key>) is "Sub", then go to number 4. But if the new read data is
	   is "Province", then add the sub_district vector (which contains all the sub-districts in each province) into the sub_districtGroup vector.
	   Now, sub_districtGroup vector is acting like a 2D array storing the index of provinces that contain sub-districts, and each of them stores
	   each sub-district's data.
	6. Once the data sub_district vector is now stored inside the Sub_DistrictGroup vector, clear the sub_district vector in order to prepare it to receive
	   new set of sub-districts in the next province.
	7. Because the algorithm will store the sub_district vector inside the sub_districtGroup vector every time the <key> is "Province". If there is no
	   preceding "Province" then the last sub_district vector will not be added into the sub_districtGroup vector, thus it should be added once the
	   algorithm finishes parsing the input file.
	8. Because the algorithm will store the sub_district vector inside the sub_districtGroup vector every time the <key> is "Province". And given that "Province" will
	   appear before "Sub" (since the province has a higher hierarchy than the sub-district), this will make the first element of the sub_districtGroup vector
	   empty, which should be removed.
