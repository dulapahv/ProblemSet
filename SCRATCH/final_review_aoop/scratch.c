/*
Compare and contrast iterative (loop) and recursive solution. Which one provides better
solution in what condition? What are good criteria for choosing one over the other.

Recursive solution is better when the problem can be divided into subproblems of the same
kind.

Iterative solution is better when the problem can be solved using a loop.
